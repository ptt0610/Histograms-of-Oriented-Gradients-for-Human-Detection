# Histograms-of-Oriented-Gradients-for-Human-Detection
This project develops a pedestrian detection system using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, evaluating the impact of HOG orientation bins on detection performance through an ablation study.
